## About me
My name is Eima Jolum. I am the main antagonist of SB737 so far. I have been trying to capture Fred but I have failed. If you are planning to join me, then please contribute!

## History
If you are, for some reason, curious about my history, then fine:

Once upon a time, maybe 2014 or 2015 or whatever, I was just getting started on a new Minecraft world when suddenly a group of unknown people came to me and asked about "SB's Awesome World", something I had never heard of until that time. When they explained that they wanted a "prophesied little king" called Fred from this world, I was then told to use an airship to come in and jump off into a cloud and that was the moment I built my first base, after which I looked around for this "Fred" but then I got caught and you can find out the rest.

## My NEW Book
This awesome friend of mine, @UnbuiltAlmond8, wrote a book about me, and put it on my fan made website which I appreciate: https://sites.google.com/view/EimaJolum
